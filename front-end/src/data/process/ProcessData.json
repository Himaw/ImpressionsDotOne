        "paragraph": "Google SafeSearch is a feature that filters out explicit or inappropriate content from Google's search results. This includes filtering out content that contains nudity, graphic violence, and other adult themes.   For YouTube, it's also important because if your video thumbnail is not appropriate (violates their guideline) it will be age restricted, which will limit the audience that can see the video, and can also lead to demonetization."
